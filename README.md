# 📘 Python Packages Handbook

This repository is a personal, structured handbook for learning, reviewing, and reusing
important Python libraries and tools used in software engineering, ML, and MLOps.

It is not a collection of random examples.
It is not a set of tutorials copied from documentation.

Each folder represents a deep, end-to-end study of one library, written in a way that allows
me to return months later and quickly rebuild both conceptual understanding and practical habits.

## Purpose of this repository

The goal of this repository is to:

- learn libraries deeply, not superficially
- preserve mental models, not just syntax
- capture engineering trade-offs and rules
- provide reviewable handouts, not just runnable code
- build a reusable engineering playbook

This repo is optimized for:

- long-term retention
- professional practice
- MLOps and production-grade thinking

---

## What this repository is not

❌ A production library  
❌ A tutorial website  
❌ A collection of copy-pasted snippets  
❌ A replacement for official documentation

*Official docs explain features.  
This repository explains how to think.*

## Repository structure
Each package folder is:

- self-contained
- internally consistent
- structured the same way where possible

This makes it easy to:

- compare tools
- cross-reference concepts
- reuse patterns

---

## Structure of each package folder

Each package folder generally contains:

- **README.md**  
  High-level explanation of the tool, its purpose, and how it fits into real projects

- **docs/**  
  One or more long-form handouts explaining concepts, rules, pitfalls, and mental models

- **src/** / **tests/** / **examples/**  
  Realistic, minimal code used to practice and reinforce ideas

Not every folder will have every subdirectory, but the intent remains consistent.

## How to use this repository

### First time learning a package
1. Read the package's README.md
2. Read the handout in docs/
3. Run and inspect the example code
4. Modify or extend examples if needed

### Reviewing a package later
1. Skim the handout top-to-bottom
2. Jump to specific sections as needed
3. Open example files to refresh muscle memory

### Reusing patterns in real projects
1. Copy structures, not code blindly
2. Adapt patterns to context
3. Use this repo as a design reference

## How this repository will grow

This repository is meant to grow **horizontally**, not vertically.

Instead of:

- endlessly expanding one package

It grows by:

- adding new tools
- keeping each one focused
- maintaining conceptual clarity

Over time, this becomes a personal engineering handbook.
